# Avoider

This is a little webgame I made where you try to avoid the obstacles coming down from the top.

### Game Instructions

The objective of this game is to use the arrow keys to move the character and avoid the falling obstacles.

Five points are awarded for each row of obstacles avoided.

After each twenty rows avoided, you level up. When you level up, the obstacles fall 5% faster, and 10 times the level 
number is added to your score.

If you are hit by an obstacle head on, then one life is taken away. If you bump into one from the side, it stops you. Once you have no more lives, the game stops.

To pause, press p.
